## About
I am currently exploring various aspects of communication synchronization, particularly focusing on blind synchronization techniques in **MIMO-OSTBC systems**. My primary tool for simulations and experiments is **MATLAB**.

## Learning Topics
1. **Blind Carrier Synchronization**
   - Synchronization without prior knowledge of the carrier signal.
   
2. **QPSK Modulation**
   - Quadrature Phase Shift Keying used for efficient signal modulation in wireless communication.
   
3. **MIMO-OSTBC**
   - Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding (OSTBC) techniques for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) systems.
   
## MATLAB Projects
1. **QPSK Modulation and Demodulation**
   - Implementing basic QPSK mod/demod schemes in MATLAB.
   
2. **Blind Synchronization Algorithms**
   - Developing algorithms for blind synchronization and testing them on MIMO systems.

Stay tuned for updates and code examples!
